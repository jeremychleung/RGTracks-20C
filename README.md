Reanalysis-Based Global Tropical Cyclone Tracks Dataset for the Twentieth Century (RGTracks-20C)
=====

**About the RGTracks-20C**
-----
- The RGTracks-20C is the first publicly available century-long reanalysis-based TC track dataset.
- The RGTracks-20C provides a long-term historical proxy record of global tropical cyclones spanning from 1850 to 2014, including including their locations, timings, and intensities information.
- The current version of the dataset is constructed from the NOAA/CIRES/DOE 20th Century Reanalysis ([20CRv3](https://www.psl.noaa.gov/data/gridded/data.20thC_ReanV3.html)) based on two tropical cyclone tracking algorithms ([UZ](https://) and [OWZ](https://) trackers).
- Please refer to [Ye et al. (2023, submitted)](https://) for more detail about the calculation procedure and the theory behind it.
